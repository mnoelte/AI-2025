## Little AI Glossary for this workshop

1. **Training**: The process of teaching an AI model using data to improve its performance.
1. **Inference**: The process of using a trained AI model to make predictions or generate outputs.
1. **Prompt**: An input given to a generative AI model to guide its output or response.
1. **System Prompt**: A predefined instruction or context given to an AI model to shape its behavior.
1. **Temperature**: A parameter that controls the randomness of a model's output; higher values increase diversity and creativity.
1. **Generative Model**: An AI model designed to create new content, such as text, images, or music.
1. **Fine-Tuning**: Adjusting a pre-trained model on a specific dataset to improve its performance on a particular task.
1. **Word Embedding**: A representation of words as vectors in a continuous vector space, where semantically similar words are mapped to nearby points.
1. **Token**: A segment of text (e.g., a word or subword) that a model processes as a single unit.
1. **Hallucination**: When a generative model produces outputs that are factually incorrect or nonsensical.
