## Little AI Glossary for this workshop

        Training: The process of teaching an AI model using data to improve its performance.
        
        Inference: The process of using a trained AI model to make predictions or generate outputs.
        
        Prompt: An input given to a generative AI model to guide its output or response.
        
        System Prompt: A predefined instruction or context given to an AI model to shape its behavior.
        
        Temperature: A parameter that controls the randomness of a model's output; higher values increase
         diversity and creativity.
         
        Generative Model: An AI model designed to create new content, such as text, images, or music.
        Fine-Tuning: Adjusting a pre-trained model on a specific dataset to improve its performance on a particular task.
        
        Word Embedding: A representation of words as vectors in a continuous vector space,
         where semantically similar words are mapped to nearby points.
         
        Token: A segment of text (e.g., a word or subword) that a model processes as a single unit.
        
        Hallucination: When a generative model produces outputs that are factually incorrect or nonsensical.
